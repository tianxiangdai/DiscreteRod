1. speedup cardillo.math with njit
2. speed up rigid body kinematics by removing common_type and decorate kinematic functions e.g. q_dot with @staticmmethod @njit
3. speed rod rod _eval and _deval with @njit
4. dense matrix better than CooMatrix, when constructing the matrix every step. Fill data according to sparcity map would be better.
